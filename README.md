Model lifecycle (retrain / publish / rollout)
Create version row
Insert into ml_models with model_id (UUID) & version (e.g., 1.2.0).

Retrain
Webhook will automatically call Retrain Cloud Run Function API.

Updates ml_models.storage_path, metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, f1, train_time_seconds).

Publish
Admin marks the selected row active=true (and sets others to false) or updates a singleton settings row with the current model_id.

Client usage
